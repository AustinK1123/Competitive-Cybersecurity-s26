# Kali linux (VM via virtualbox)

### Uses for having linux on a VM.
As a person using tools to decipher or change files to be able to read them or encrypt them it comes in handy to have a VM for running command lines.
The main use for having a Linux VM is to have a testing environment secluded from the main operating system to run commands in a safe setting.
It can help to separate the system into a separate environment to allow for mistakes due to error or when using commands on files and they have malware or corrupts files within.
When testing it is important to have a replicable environment so if an issue occurs it can be reset or remade without harming the main operating system.
A VM can be made in many ways a favorite of mine is to use oracle virtual box to create Linux and Windows VM's you can get the system from " “.
