 ## WHOIS

 [WHOIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS) is a protocol for querying databases that store information about Internet resources and domain names.

 A domain name is a human-readable address that identifies resources on the Internet. Instead of the numerical IP addresses (e.g. 8.8.8.8) that computers use, domain names (e.g. google.com) provide an easier way for humans to access the Internet.

 The cityinthe.cloud domain name can be broken down into two components:

`cityinthe` - The second-level domain
`.cloud` - The top-level domain (TLD)

A quick search of the .cloud top-level domain shows that the .cloud TLD is delegated by ICANN and managed by Aruba S.p.A., making these two organizations authoritative sources regarding the .cloud TLD.
