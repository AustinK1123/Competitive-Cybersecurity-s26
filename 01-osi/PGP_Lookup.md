PGP lookup is finding and identifying public keys using tools luckily there are browser tools available to make the prosses simple, but each is a database that is not always up to date to looking across multiple sites is best practice. in simple terms PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is commercial version of GPG which is an open source encryption software. It is a method to create keys to send to other users on the web to alow for endpoint encryption and decryption of files, data and act as an key to allow autherized/trusted users into cloud file and partitions. anybody with a key maniger like some of the sommon one used (https://www.openpgp.org/software/ you can find a PGP manaager for many platororms hear) can be used to store and manage GpG keys. the key mangers will each have there own prefered email manger to encrip and decript emails but that veerys form manager to manager.
