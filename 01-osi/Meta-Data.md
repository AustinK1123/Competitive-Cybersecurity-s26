## Tools
* I used [MetaData2Go](https://www.metadata2go.com/), however it requires signing in. 
* [Pics.io](https://pics.io/photo-metadata-viewer) had the same information but didn't require signing in. 
* To switch GPS from Degree, Minutes, Seconds to decimal I used [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/dms-decimal)
## Notes
* current_iptc_digest is the MD5 hash value used to verify that the IPTC-IIM(Information Interchange Model) data has not been changed. That is the storage of the meta data.
* exif_byte_order determines how multibyte data is ordered. 
    * Little-Endian II is least significant byte stored first. 
    * Big-Endian MM is most significant byte stored first. 
        * The significance of a bit is determined by how far right they are in binary numbers. So how much of the overall value they change
